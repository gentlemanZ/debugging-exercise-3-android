# Apprentice Android Debugging Workshop 3

This project contains exercises for the Android debugging workshop

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to fix a number of problems in this app.

1. Convert existing Log statements to use Timber
2. Network: Using appropriate logging levels...
  * Add a log statement to print the URL being requested
  * Add a log statement to print the network response
  * Add other log statements as needed to figure out why the request doesn't work
3. Sort:
  * Using the debugger, fix the bugs in each of the sorting test cases
4. Search:
  * Using the debugger, fix the bugs in each of the search test cases
5. Bonus:
  * Using the debugger, figure out why sometimes the count of button presses doesn't show the right value.

Throughout this exercise, be aware of Lint warnings - sometimes they will highlight problems!
